Firstly, edit logpath and serverdb path in "client.py"
Correct "backend_list.txt", if needed
    But if you correct it, you should revise "launcher.sh" !

Assuming that you launched terminal in "HighloadTester" directory

Then launch "build-images.sh"

After, start "launcher.sh <backend number>"

Finally, You can launch "client.py"
